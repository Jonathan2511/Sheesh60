# Sheesh60 Prototype Keyboard PCB
Sheesh60 PCB Prototype designed using KiCad. The layout is inspired by OwLab Spring and KBDFans Maja with some modification of my own.

Key differences:
- Key Rotation is 10° instead of 12°.
- Adjusted key spacing.
- Tweaked the bottom row.
- Compatible With Arduino Pro Micro or STM32F401.

As you may or may not know, I have previously created and designed a keyboard called Sheesh40, this time I made a 60 percent version of Sheesh40 with several similarities.
